I'm graduated in Digital Technologies from the University of Caxias do Sul, post-graduated in User Experience from the Anhembi Morumbi University and Teaching and Performance in Distance Education at Descomplica. An eternal student.

I work as an instructor and software developer in a front-end team at Alura Cursos Online and Front-end Developer at LuizaLabs. I work with agile methodologies (SCRUM) and produce courses in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and React, where I already have more than 100 thousand enrollments in total. In all projects I use Git for code separation and versioning.
